**Competing with Airbnb: A Detailed Analysis for Middle-Class Retired Couples**

**Project Description**
This project, titled "Competing with Airbnb: Affordable Housing Solutions for Middle-Class Retired Couples in Amsterdam," aims to explore the rental property market in Amsterdam with a focus on middle-class retired couples. The project utilizes data-driven analysis to identify housing options that balance affordability, comfort, and accessibility, catering specifically to the needs of this demographic.

**Key Findings and Their Impact**

**1. Market Analysis and Trends**

Price vs. Frequency Trends: The analysis revealed a high concentration of rental properties in the lower price ranges, indicating a trend towards affordability in the market. The majority of listings are available at lower prices, with a significant drop in frequency as prices increase. This suggests that budget-friendly options are more prevalent, which is beneficial for middle-class retirees seeking cost-effective accommodations.

Impact: This finding underscores the availability of affordable housing options, allowing retirees to make informed decisions about where to stay based on their budget constraints.

**2. Neighbourhood Popularity and Characteristics**

Neighbourhood Popularity: The study identified areas with high densities of accommodation listings, highlighting popular neighbourhoods. Consistently high ratings in these areas suggest that they meet the comfort and safety standards valued by retirees.

Impact: Retirees can prioritize these highly rated neighbourhoods for their stay, ensuring a comfortable and satisfying experience.

Comparative Cost of Living: The analysis of average prices across neighbourhoods showed significant economic differences. Some neighbourhoods, like Bos en Lommer, offer more budget-friendly options, while areas like Centrum-West are more expensive but provide better amenities.

Impact: This helps retirees identify neighbourhoods that fit their financial constraints while also considering the quality of life offered by different areas.

**3. Room Type Distribution and Preferences**

Room Type Preferences: The majority of listings are for entire homes or apartments, which are preferred by retirees for their privacy and comfort. Private rooms also present a viable option, offering a balance between cost and privacy.

Impact: This information helps retirees choose accommodations that best meet their preferences for space and amenities without exceeding their budget.

**4. Housing Affordability and Selection**

Price Sensitivity and Satisfaction: The study found that middle-class retirees are sensitive to price variations, with a preference for accommodations within a $150 budget. The availability of affordable options in various neighbourhoods provides a range of choices for retirees.

Impact: Retirees can focus their search on neighbourhoods that offer the best value for money, enhancing their overall living experience.

Proximity to City Centre: Proximity to the city centre varies, with some neighbourhoods offering closer access than others. This influences the convenience and accessibility of accommodations for retirees.

Impact: Retirees can consider their mobility and convenience needs when selecting accommodations, ensuring they remain well-connected to the cityâ€™s attractions and amenities.

**5. Market Gaps and Opportunities**

Housing Solutions: There is a clear need for housing options that specifically cater to the needs of middle-class retired couples, emphasizing affordability, safety, and accessibility.

Impact: This presents an opportunity for housing providers to develop targeted solutions that enhance the living experience for retirees, potentially increasing market demand.

User-Friendly Platforms: Enhancing housing search platforms with customizable filters can significantly improve the search experience for retirees, making it easier for them to find suitable accommodations.

Impact: Improved search tools can lead to higher satisfaction rates among retirees, fostering a loyal customer base.

Community Engagement: Developing social spaces and organizing community events can foster a sense of belonging among retirees, enhancing their overall experience in their chosen neighbourhoods.

Impact: Increased community engagement can lead to higher satisfaction and retention rates among retirees, making neighbourhoods more appealing to this demographic.

**Conclusion**
This project highlights the diverse and affordable housing options available in Amsterdam for middle-class retired couples. By focusing on affordability, comfort, and accessibility, retirees can find suitable accommodations that enhance their living experience. The findings provide valuable insights for both retirees and housing providers, emphasizing the need for tailored housing solutions and improved search tools.
